## General Info
This project is still under development. I plan to implement the Add, Edit buttons for both Author and Book and make a working Search bar. Also add User and Admin capabilites and most important of all implement JPA into the project. 

## Introduction
Book Shelf is a library website like a cheap version of "goodreads". However, my version is done only using free software and does not contain any JavaScript. The main focus was the ability to explore the catalog from authors to publishers.
